# Inclined-DSA

This repository is created to **track my progress** in learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **Java**, improve my skills in DSA, and make **digital notes** along the way.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Basics
- Arrays
- (Add more topics as I progress)

Each topic will have its own folder, and within each topic folder, the content will be organized day-wise. For example, under the Arrays folder, you will find subfolders like **Day01**, **Day02**, etc., where I’ll store the notes and practice problems for that day. 

Each day-wise folder will include:
- 📝 **notes.md**: Concepts and explanations covered that day.
- 💻 Java code files: Solutions to practice problems.
- ✍️ **Handwritten digital content**: Occasionally, I will include digital board work or hand-drawn explanations if needed.
